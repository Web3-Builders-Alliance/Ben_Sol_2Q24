pet that dog! is a launch pad for proof-of-interaction SPL tokens. Pet dogs, mint tokens.

## Spring 2023 Cosmos Cohort

I built Disburser, an x/feeshare contract designed to handle automated disbursement of fees generated by a dapp to its team of developers based on their percentage ownership of the underlying application.

It was launched on Juno testnet, but that has since been taken down, changed, or purged of old contracts (not sure).

The repo can be found here: https://github.com/bgoober/Disburser
